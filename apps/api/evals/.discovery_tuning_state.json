        "Add more specific achievements from their profile - reference the 'mobile app launch' or '3x DAU growth' directly to make questions feel more personalized",
        "Shorten some questions by removing setup phrases - 'At StartupXYZ PM role - you were basically doing user acceptance testing' could be 'As StartupXYZ PM, you caught bugs in production - what edge case saved the team?'",
        "Add escape hatches to prevent over-lingering: 'If debugging doesn't resonate, think about when clients questioned your code choices...'"

          "reasoning": "These questions excel at reframing existing experience as leadership strengths, showing Alex their microservices work IS system design ownership. Strong executive coach voice that affirms current value while uncovering hidden achievements. Minor dock for repetitive 'TechCorp' framing and could be slightly more conversational."

Strong bridge-building between 'junior developer' tasks and senior requirements like performance optimization and technical leadership. Questions are concise and mentoring-focused, though some topics overlap slightly."

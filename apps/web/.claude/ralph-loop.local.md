based on the plan, implement the feature and add proper tests to ensure they pass. Before each loop, read AB_test_plan.md file in the repo specs folder, if not exist, create it. in each loop after implementation, use code-review to self check work and fix it. Ensure each loop the code gets shorter and simpler. After each loop, write into AB_test_plan.md what you have done (which files chabged and what feature added/modified) and add new steps. Ensure each loop you work on the most important thing, keep loop going until things are done.
